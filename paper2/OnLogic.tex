#start with logic. info frame is a boolean sigma algebra.
#invertable kernels are logical isomorphisms
#overlapping degrees of freedom are independent sublogics
#coupling rules how logics are glued along shared sublogics
#coarse greaining quocient logic, or minimal logic that expresses truth.
# There are multiple local logics about a single world, they are not all 
#simultaneously embeddable in one global algebra
#Reason: if they were, godel incompletness would trigger, showing they cannot be complete
